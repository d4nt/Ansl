Ansl (A .NET Search Library)

Usage:

    var engine = new Ansl.Engine();
    engine.Index(
        new Ansl.Document(
            "test1.txt",
            "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"));
    engine.Index(
        new Ansl.Document(
            "test2.txt",
            "Hello World"));

    foreach (var result in engine.Search(new string[] { "fox" }))
    {
        Assert.AreEqual("test1.txt", result);
		
    }

The Ansl.Engine class implements the TF-IDF algorithm.

By default the Engine will be case in-sensitive and will store it's index
in memory. To change this pass an Ansl.EngineOptions class and an 
implementation of the Ansl.IIndexStore interface into the Engine's
constructor.

This library comes with an alternative implementation of the IIndexStore
called IndexDirectoryStore which will store the index in a named folder.
Use this if you intend to index documents and the search them with a new
instance of the Engine class later on.
